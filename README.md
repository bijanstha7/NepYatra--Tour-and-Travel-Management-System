<p> The project "Nep Yatra: Easing Your Trip to Nepal (Tour and Travel Management System)" automates all travel and tourism processes, including user information, creation, booking, and confirmation. The project is built with Microsoft SQL Server as the backend and HTML-PHP as the front end, making it compatible with all browsers. HTML and PHP were the coding languages utilized. A single dynamic website is used to book a tour from anywhere in the globe, allowing users to find out all the information they need about the locations and the tour specifics in one spot. By creating a tour page, the administrator may add packages to the website from certain hotels and travel agencies. Then, after logging in, users may book each package or buy products, which the admin can then confirm on the page where they handle bookings. The user's "my booking" page will display the confirmation. It is the most user-friendly tool for booking travel arrangements and getting complete information.</p>
